This project aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. The dataset consists of 22 attributes and over 2 lakh rows which we will be using for training and testing. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle. The type of model/data mining task that will be used for the prediction is binary classification.

Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases impacting millions of people each year physically, mentally, and financially. The disease poses the danger where individuals lose the ability to regulate glucose levels in the blood, leading to complications like heart disease, vision loss, lower-limb amputation, and kidney diseases. Although there is no known cure for diabetes, many individuals can lessen its negative effects by adopting lifestyle changes such as decreasing weight, eating a healthy diet, exercising, and receiving medical care. This model would be very useful for public and public health officials as early diagnosis of diabetics can lead to lifestyle changes and more effective treatment.
